        <h2>Chapter II</h2>
        <p>Navya first things first... I can never think of hurting you your family.. I say never in any ways.. 
(I never got clearly talk to you also) 
Whatever the circumstances araised were extremely difficult for me to understand and calibrate the reasons  it all started from the night I was leaving for my village in the train around 2am maybe midnight I was talking to my friend in the couch having the boat head phones on my neck I pressed the button to switch it off but instead in dialed the favorite call log number and I was not aware of it I kept the headphones aside and was talking with my friends but on the other hand the call went to you your parents took it up assuming I purposely called you but that wasn't I wasn't even aware later you know what happened you made me realize that I called you and after that my freaking phone got damaged and then I couldn't even clarify the things.. I thought after I reach I will clear it but... My mom said no worries
            she will talk cause it was by mistake happened na... But things started escalating from there I realized when you called me told the whole thing after two days... I was so confused and worried that time didn't understand what to do so I waited so I can talk face to face clearly after arriving home...But yes after that my fam had planned tirupati trip so nearly for a month I was out of reach and everything just fumbled.. Let me take you exactly where was I...  </p>

        <h2>Chapter III</h2>
        <p>The things messed I know but I thought would settle with time so I didn't react much (i am not spreading any hatred on anyone just explaing what happened) after some days naveen called he said something terrible happened and he was just scaring me and not telling what then after taking all nonsense for a hour he said it was all prank.. I was very disappointed but then thought let it go again next day he texted the same something awful and deadly going I asked what again he said nothing
            I said ok he did same thing for 5 6 days straight I was so frustrated I called him said what is the problem just tell or leave it why you troubling like this again is was like sorry and will not do it then after some time he again started this time very much he was threatening yeh hogaya voh hogaya I was like kya hogaya kya problem.. He said navya got in some accident vagera vagwra I  said what... That time we were not taking right I was scared and confused isiliye bhich may I called you with some unknown number to verify but you were alright may bola yeh kya faltu giri kar  rha hai naveen but he said mazaak kar
            rha tha like this he just tortured me the whole time until I was back to mumbai at some time I even blocked him he was just messing up me but all the time i was patient not knowing what to do i was not even asking anything anyone not to know what to trust what was the issue.. As I reached Mumbai I thought everything got normal till that time merko tho sab normal tha.. But fir ek din naveen met me and said why did you abuse navya.. 
        I said what I abused her... he said you complained your parents that I was troubling you abused you and harassed you in texts and kept on doing it that's why you had to block me.. I was like I don't think any such thing happened yes she did block me and not talking with me right now but abusing or harassment was never an issue.. He said your parents are really upset that I was treating you so bad and troubling you so many times they asked naveen to talk to me.. I was like when did they say it you he said 15 20 days back I asked why didn't you tell me at that time naveen said then arey bhai mazak kar raha hue aisa kuch nahi hue everything is alright I was just pranking you again
. . I was really furious this time I left from there after arguing for some time that how mean he could be to play so much with my emotions

        <h2>Chapter IV</h2>
        <p>  I went home and told my mom from past one month like this naveen is doing and now he just crossed limits and was getting on my nerves my mom said don't worry I know you won't trouble any girl or harassing is just not possible and to get relaxed she will see what's the issue after that I got little calm.. And then suddenly next day naveen calls me to sumit anna home saying weare planning for trip come over so..I went there every one was there aunty uncle my mom naveen sumit khushi mummy everyone was staring at me as I was a criminal I said what happened they all just charged upon me one by one saying I was abusive with you troubling you and tried to harass you faking all love and relationship promises and traping you in it.. All these things naveen and sumit both together told to everyone and everyone was trying to console me why I am doing this things

I was like terrified not able to speak my throat literally dried like anything I was just freaking out from inside I was sitting on the chair and from all sides everyone questioning why did I do that why are you harassing navya so much.. That time really navya my mind got blocked I was not in the situation to think anything I only said she was very dear friend of mine and I never ever in my life did any abusive thing to her ...naveen said aryan was trying to make navya get into relationship forcefully even she was avoiding him .. Everyone said so much to me.. I was like didn't do anything such I was very respectful with her any time and never even felt I was abusive or harassing her in any ways.. Sumit papa mummy said lets call rekha aunty here and clarify... You mom came then I don't know what she was thinking about me or what she was told about me but it was clear that she was also on the same side that I was troubling you and trying to get you  into a forced relationship she just came was really respectful with me and asked why am I not listening to naveen from past one month.. I said I wasn't told anything from last one month naveen didn't say a word to me he just talked nonsense and then ended it with saying prank kiya.. Aunty was really emotional that time whole room was silent naveen said aunty I tried to convince aryan but hes  behavior was very violent and was not listening to me 
((he was clearly lying)) I said what  I never even spoke to you in a harsh tone and regarding convincing you never told me anything you never even stated any problematic situation all he told was everything is alright I am just pranking you everytime for fun.. I was just sitting there clueless and fully traumatized same time everyone was confused  mom started crying seeing all this .. You know I started tearing up felt so terrible at the time to see moms tears full of red eyes I said enough I was completely broken I said aunty whatever happened I am really sorry.. Extremely sorry for it navya was always a good friend of mine I never meant to abuse her or hurt her.. I promise I won't do it again and not let any such thing happen again I. Always thought you all has my family and will never do any such thing that hurts you all or make anybody cry . 
Aunty said ok .we left from there  I told everything to my mom and dad my parents were still confident enough that I was never like a boy who will force or harass a girl that to not you navya.. Even they knew you were my best friend.. My mom never said anything to me she just said why didn't navya speak up.. Why didn't she never backed up you if she was your friend.. I had no answer I was in fact so immensely disturbed I didn't wanted to think anything about it my mind was not searching any clarification it just wanted to run away run far from home and settle anywhere far  away from this where nobody knows me .. Then I didn't have the courage to even talk to you or ask you what happened..
            Even multiple times I saw you I couldn't speak up

        <h2>Chapter V</h2>
        <p>. But inside I always felt that you also consider me as a good friend rather not as troublesome psychotic guy who use to abuse you.. But never really understood why all that happened what made things so much worse and why didn't ever I got chance to speak with you about this. 

Almost more than 4 years passed I still consider you as my very good friend 
.. I never ever in my life wanted to hurt you or rekha aunty srinivas uncle or aditya in any way.. I consider us has a family... Where the whole thing I wanted to keep a smile on everyones face honestly you were my favorite navya I thought I will always never let you down in any way . But after all I realized I was just a very immature, foolish and irresponsible guy who couldn't do any such thing... Sachi bolu tho I did many mistakes...many times I was careless but I never forced you, harassed or abused you navya.. Never in my life even imagine doing such things.. I don't know how come all these things happened... I had no. Control over things navya I didn't know what was happening never you trusted enough to share ...circumstances were so complicated I was not able to. Do anything I don't say it's your fault but understand I was helpless I was not capable of handling it couldn't figure out what and why.. Solution tho durr ki baath... You know when you said you screwed up my life you know it hunts me thinking about that even after doing nothing I mean literally nothing was in my hands and no where I did anything wrong in the whole time I was just getting played around like football just absolutely with no self control.. Still I here regret everytime why did it happen what was reason.. Did I really harassed you..? Did I abused you? Was naveen right..
        But my soul never accepts it I aryan can never even think of hurting navya.. Never ever even in his dreams. Navya I am really really sorry for everything what happened.. Again I never wanted you to even feel slightest discomfort
But I don't know what why the circumstances got so complex...

        <h2>Chapter VI</h2>
        <p>I don't know even if you believe me or not but this is the thing that happened..

 I swear for my life that I was never a guy that harassed you but always supported you I made this just to explain you the things how it carried out the situation that made me look. Like criminal when I wasn't.. I know its hard you to digest everything ..i thought you would never believe me or understand.. That's why never gathered courage to explain myself but.. Let me tell you I don't what. To be your enemy or be a traitor in your eyes that's why I wrote all these things to so I could make it clear.. That aryan is not that bad as you or your family thinks its the circumstances that created a illusion

I don't know even still you would believe me or not but please at least recognize me as human that exists who is trying his almight just to get rid of the misunderstanding that he is not that bad guy but a person who got framed has it were
I know things got really shit.. I never want you to get over anything such in life again.. But I really wished I had chance to fix it.. Please forgive me for my decisions.. Its really difficult to happen but I wonder if ever we could just be normal as we use to without any misunderstanding
