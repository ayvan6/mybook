        <h2>Chapter II</h2>
        <p>Navya first things first... I can never think of hurting you your family.. I say never in any ways.. 
(I never got clearly talk to you also) 
Whatever the circumstances araised were extremely difficult for me to understand and calibrate the reasons  it all started from the night I was leaving for my village in the train around 2am maybe midnight I was talking to my friend in the couch having the boat head phones on my neck I pressed the button to switch it off but instead in dialed the favorite call log number and I was not aware of it I kept the headphones aside and was talking with my friends but on the other hand the call went to you your parents took it up assuming I purposely called you but that wasn't I wasn't even aware later you know what happened you made me realize that I called you and after that my freaking phone got damaged and then I couldn't even clarify the things.. I thought after I reach I will clear it but... My mom said no worries
            she will talk cause it was by mistake happened na... But things started escalating from there I realized when you called me told the whole thing after two days... I was so confused and worried that time didn't understand what to do so I waited so I can talk face to face clearly after arriving home... </p>
